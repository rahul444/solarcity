Coding Challenge Guidelines
---------------------------

[Coding Challenge Guidelines](ChallengeInstructions.md)

Readme
------

You will need to include a README in your submission. Write your
README as if it was for a production application. Include the following items:

* A description of the problem and solution.
* While all submissions are expected to be a full stack application, let us know whether your solution is more focused on back-end, front-end or full stack development (While most of our engineers work full stack in some capacity, for the purpose of the coding challenge no preference is paid towards any specific track.).
* Reasoning behind your technical choices. Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.
* (Optional) Link to other code you're particularly proud of.

Review Process
--------------

Your application will be reviewed by the software engineering team. The aspects of your code we will judge include:

* Clarity: Does the README clearly explains the problem and solution?
* Correctness: Does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
* Code quality: is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable?
* UX: is the web interface understandable and pleasing to use?
* Technical choices: Choices of libraries, databases, architecture etc.
